  - First-Come-First-Serve (FCFS)
  - Shortest Seek Time First (SSTF)
  - SCAN (Elevator)
  - LOOK
  - C-SCAN
  - C-LOOK
- Visual representation of head movement
- Calculation of total head movement
- User-friendly interface (CLI or GUI as applicable)
- Modular and extensible codebase

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Programming Language:  `Python`
- (Optional) GUI Framework: `Tkinter` / `JavaFX` / etc.
- Version Control: `Git`
